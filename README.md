## JHU Developing Data Products week 4 shiny project.

[Application link](https://bmerr.shinyapps.io/project_working_directory/#1)  

This application features a plot of a histogram of 2023 median home sales price data by US state where the intervals(bins) are controlled by a slider.
You can move the slider to the number of intervals needed for the histogram. The histogram will use the slider value as the number of intervals. The slider has a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 50 intervals.
The height of the bars indicates the count or frequency of states that are in that range of values defined by the interval value.
